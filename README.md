## Coded Distributed Computations for Matrix Multiplication tasks

* In large-scale systems there are several types of noise that can affect the performance of distributed machine learning algorithms â€“ straggler nodes or system failures
* How can we avoid recompute the MatMul?
* We need use coding for provide stable distributed matrix multiplication algorithm
